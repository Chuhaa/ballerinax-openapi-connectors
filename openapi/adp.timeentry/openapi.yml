  title: ADP Time Entry
  description: |
    This is a generated connector for [ADP Time Entry API v1](https://developers.adp.com/articles/api/time-entry-v1-api) OpenAPI specification.
    The Time Entry API provides the capability to support the viewing of entries for a time period as specified by the System of Record (SOR) and may allow the creation and deletion of time entries based on rules determined by the SOR. 
    If authorized, the APIs support the resolution of exceptions in a timesheet and the review of timesheets.
  version: 1.0.0
