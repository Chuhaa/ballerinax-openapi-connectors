                                                       the rate, or rate over what.
                                                       In the example 5 US dollars
                                                       per hour, the baseUnitCode
                                                       is hour. In the example 3
                                                       bags of rice per month, the
                                                       baseUnitCode is month. If
                                                       for example, the rate was
                                                       10 US dollars for every widget
                                                       produced, the baseUnitCode
                                                       would be widget. In the example,
                                                       20 percent of annual sales,
                                                       the baseUnitCode would equate
                                                       to annual sales"
