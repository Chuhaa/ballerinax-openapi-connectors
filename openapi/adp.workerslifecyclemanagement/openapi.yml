  description: |
    This is a generated connector for [ADP Workers API v2](https://developers.adp.com/articles/api/workers---lifecycle-management-v2-api) OpenAPI specification.
    The Workers Lifecycle Management API provides the capability to manage workers work lifecycle.
    The worker.hire event indicates the creation of a work agreement between a person and an employer for the first time EVER. 
    Worker.Hire always results in a primary work assignment. Worker.hire may result in a worker status of either 'Active' or 'Pending' depending on whether or not the Worker.Start event is supported by the system of record.
  version: 2.0.0
